**Wii U USB GCN Controller Adapter v2.5 CHANGELOG**

* Controllers can now be turned on and off in the Configuration menu.

* The vJoy driver now defaults to deactivating when the program is closed (configurable).

* ***Controllers no longer require calibration*** (use "reset to default" in the windows calibration properties to fix existing calibrations).

* A "clear log" button has been added.

* A different LibUSB install method that should work better on windows 8 has been implemented.
